# LYYCarDetector
 This project is a collection of programs for vehicle detection and identification, and at the same time, a part of the data set and the latest program design will be uploaded one after another.

#该部分将会持续更新并LYY的开源车辆目标检测程序

#主要基于平台为最新的Matlab 2020a，安装和环境搭建可以联系作者LYY。

#同时相关作者相关论文中的数据集也将会在这里同步发布。

#由于GitHub的上传限制，对于较大的.mat模型文件可以联系作者获取。

#值得注意的是，按照审稿人要求，将实验过程中所需要的数据集存放于网盘当中 。

#English: This part will continuously update and lyy's open source vehicle target detection program. It is mainly based on the latest Matlab 2020A platform. For installation and environment construction, please contact the author lyy. At the same time, the data sets of relevant authors and relevant papers will also be published synchronously here. Due to the upload limitation of GitHub, you can contact the author for larger. mat model files. It is worth noting that, according to the requirements of the reviewer, the data sets required in the experimental process are stored in the network disk.
